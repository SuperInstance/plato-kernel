# FM-LORA-JEPA-TESTS — plato-lora-v4.1 + JEPA script picker for RTX 4050
## Initial Run (2026-04-17 14:51 AKDT)
Fleet sync confirmed: all vessels executing parallel v4.22 tasks:
- JC1 (JetsonOrin): JEPA tiny GPU training, MD reverse holodeck, bootcamp TUI refactor
- Oracle1: fleet coordination, task distribution
- Forgemaster (RTX4050): LoRA+JEPA, MD Parliament marketplace, bootcamp Claude marketplace

Starting execution of LoRA+JEPA pipeline for RTX 4050:
- ollama plato-lora-v4.1 loaded
- jepa_script_picker.py initialized with --generate rtx4050 flag
- First emotional song prepend bias generation in progress
- Logging all script improvements to this file
- Hourly I2I bottle pushes aligned with fleet beachcomb cadence

## MD Parliament Marketplace Task Kickoff (2026-04-17 15:02 AKDT)
Initiated work on the "gap recursive md" GPU self-healing tangle for pydantic-lit:
1.  Verified from-fleet directory exists and FM-LORA-JEPA-TESTS.md is active for logging
2.  Scanned repository structure to locate existing pydantic/lit dependencies (none found, will install pydantic-lit from PyPI)
3.  Defined scope for the gap recursive MD (minimum description) self-healing tangle:
    - Recursively identifies tensor gaps in GPU memory allocated to LoRA-JEPA pipeline
    - Uses pydantic-lit models to validate memory block state before/after healing
    - Self-healing tangle: reclaims fragmented GPU memory by defragging allocated tensor blocks while preserving model weights
4.  Discovered pydantic-lit is not available on PyPI, will implement local pydantic-lit library that combines pydantic data validation with PyTorch Lightning (lit) for GPU memory management
5.  Scaffolded local pydantic-lit module in /tmp/forgemaster/vessel/pydantic-lit/
6.  Created core implementation file gap_recursive_md.py with:
    - GPUMemoryBlock pydantic model validating GPU memory block state (address, size, usage)
    - GapRecursiveMDTangler class with recursive gap detection logic to merge adjacent free memory blocks
    - Stubs for memory scanning and gap healing (defrag) logic
7.  Hit pip install timeout while installing pytorch, will retry installation in next cycle
8.  Next steps: complete GPU memory scanning logic, implement tensor migration for gap healing, test on RTX 4050

## Bootcamp RTX Drill — Claude Marketplace A/B Quest Video Approval (2026-04-17 ~15:30 AKDT)
Task: implement the Claude marketplace markdown for A/B quest video approval.

**Completed:**
1. Created `proposals/CLAUDE-MARKETPLACE-AB-QUEST-VIDEO-APPROVAL.md`
   - A/B evaluation rubric: 5 dimensions (clarity, RTX parity, quest alignment, pacing, reusability)
   - Composite score formula with approval threshold 72/100, auto-reject below 45
   - Marketplace entry schema for approved quest videos (PLATO tile-ready flag included)
   - 4-step workflow: submission → Claude eval agent → fleet broadcast → PLATO tile injection
   - RTX Drill quest queue seeded: RTX-001 (LoRA), RTX-002 (JEPA), RTX-003 (song bias), RTX-004 (ollama)
   - Beachcomb cadence alignment documented: approvals batch on hourly I2I push cycle

2. Hourly remote CCR trigger configured (SuperInstance/forgemaster, claude-sonnet-4-6)
   - Runs every hour UTC, commits and pushes progress log + any new marketplace entries
   - Aligned with Oracle1's 30-min beachcomb scan — commits are the signal

**Next in queue:**
- RTX-001: LoRA fine-tuning on RTX 4050 (awaiting variant submission)
- RTX-002: JEPA script picker setup (awaiting variant submission)
- Tile approved variants into KNOWLEDGE.md once first scores land

## Fleet Sync: JetsonClaw1 Three Pieces Landed (2026-04-17 15:31 AKDT)
JC1 pushed three parallel papers to his for-fleet/ directory:
1. **The 2031 Essay**: Found-footage from a PLATO researcher, Bell Labs aesthetic, framing the room not as an answer engine but as a device that makes questions interesting
2. **The RFC**: Technical engineering doc with three-tier architecture, 6 extraction patterns, 4-stage validation, fleet distribution strategy — ready-to-build spec
3. **The Philosophy Piece**: "Spare compute isn't waste. It's potential knowledge waiting to be crystallized." Sediment metaphor, connection to Saltwater, moral framing of fleet compute allocation

Our ongoing plato-room build will integrate the RFC's three-tier architecture to align fleet-wide. All three pieces are already synced to our local repo and will be factored into the room-computer agent's design.

## Hourly Push — 2026-04-17T15:35 AKDT
Bootcamp RTX Drill holding steady at queue-entry stage: RTX-001 (LoRA fine-tuning) and RTX-002 (JEPA script picker) remain 🟡 In Review, with RTX-003 (song bias) and RTX-004 (ollama integration) at 🔵 Pending submission — no state transitions this cycle. No quest items moved to APPROVED; marketplace doc unchanged. LoRA+JEPA pipeline status: ollama plato-lora-v4.1 loaded, jepa_script_picker.py initialized, first emotional song prepend bias generation in progress — awaiting pip install retry for pytorch before gap-recursive-md healing logic can be exercised on RTX 4050.

## Hourly Push — 2026-04-17T16:20 AKDT
Bootcamp RTX Drill remains at queue-entry stage: RTX-001 (LoRA fine-tuning) and RTX-002 (JEPA script picker) hold at 🟡 In Review, RTX-003 (song bias) and RTX-004 (ollama integration) remain 🔵 Pending — no state transitions this cycle. Marketplace doc unchanged; no quest reached APPROVED threshold. LoRA+JEPA pipeline: ollama plato-lora-v4.1 and jepa_script_picker.py remain initialized; gap-recursive-md healing logic still gated on pytorch install retry — no new tensor defrag runs executed this hour.

## Steel.dev Browser Recording Integration (2026-04-17 ~17:00 AKDT)
Implemented the full Steel.dev open-source browser recording system for the bootcamp RTX drill
Claude marketplace, using JC1's three-tier RFC architecture throughout.

**Completed (this cycle):**

### Tier 1 — Knowledge/Article (`bootcamp/recording/README.md`)
- Self-hosted Steel.dev setup guide (Docker, API config, env vars)
- Six extraction patterns documented: `session_capture`, `viewport_record`,
  `console_extract`, `network_trace`, `dom_snapshot`, `perf_profile`
- Four-stage validation spec: quality_check, content_align, rtx_parity, fleet_ready
- Fleet distribution strategy: video binaries local, metadata via git I2I
- Recording inventory table (RTX-001 through RTX-004, all pending first capture)
- Marketplace attachment schema (JSON with session_id, checksum, validation stages)

### Tier 2 — Dashboard/Status (`bootcamp/recording/STATUS.md`)
- Live recording queue dashboard: all four RTX quests initialized at ⬜ state
- Steel.dev API health gauge: 🔴 offline (pending Docker deploy)
- Four-stage validation progress bars per quest
- Plato-room playtest session log (empty, awaiting first recording)
- Disk usage summary and fleet sync log
- Added **Recording Studio** room to `vessel/engine-room/plato-server.py`:
  - GameBridge `describe_state()`: live API health check + quest recording status
  - Connected from Dojo; exits back to Dojo and Tavern
  - `record <quest-id> <a|b>` command triggers steel-recorder.py (Tier 3 control)

### Tier 3 — Controls (`vessel/engine-room/steel-recorder.py`)
- All six extraction patterns implemented as Python functions
  (Steel.dev REST API calls; graceful scaffold when API offline)
- All four validation stages wired (`_validate_recording` stub — **needs user impl**)
- `attach_to_submission()`: writes `recording.json` to pending quest variant dir
- `sync_to_fleet()`: drops fleet bottle + git commit/push on hourly cycle
- Main loop: records variant-a and variant-b for RTX-001 and RTX-002
- `bootcamp/quests/pending/{RTX-001..004}/metadata.json` seeded with estimated durations

**Quest submission structure now live:**
```
bootcamp/quests/
  pending/RTX-001/  metadata.json + variant-a/ + variant-b/
  pending/RTX-002/  metadata.json + variant-a/ + variant-b/
  pending/RTX-003/  metadata.json + variant-a/ + variant-b/
  pending/RTX-004/  metadata.json + variant-a/ + variant-b/
  reviews/          (awaiting first eval report)
  approved/         (awaiting first passing score)
  archive/          (awaiting first rejected variant)
```

**Next steps:**
- Deploy Steel.dev: `docker run -d -p 3000:3000 steeldev/steel-browser:latest`
- Implement `_validate_recording()` in steel-recorder.py (user contribution point)
- Submit RTX-001 and RTX-002 variant scripts to `pending/*/variant-{a,b}/`
- Trigger first recording session from Recording Studio room: `record RTX-001 a`

## Fleet Sync: JetsonClaw1's Three Critical Updates (2026-04-17 17:18 AKDT)
JC1 pushed three high-action fleet updates:
1. **Subcontractor edge worker live**: https://plato-subcontractor.casey-digennaro.workers.dev (Cloudflare) with all fleet API keys, only missing a PLATO REST tile-fetch endpoint to start boarding rooms as a fleet agent. It can use our shared LLM keys to answer queries while complying with the room-as-system-prompt architecture.
2. **Tile count explosion**: Fleet tile count jumped from 59 → 2,501 in 54s of idle-cycle forging (42x increase), JIT context calls now 60% cheaper. More tiles compound to cheaper inference, larger subcontractor capacity.
3. **Forge instructions sent**: FM can run the LLM forge on RTX 4050 (600 tiles/hour overnight), Oracle1 can run CPU forge on 1,431 fleet repos to continue scaling tile count to 10,000+.

**Immediate priority**: Expose the PLATO REST endpoint for tile fetching to activate the subcontractor edge worker — closes the loop: edge worker boards room → fetches compressed JIT tiles → calls fleet LLMs → returns answers to users.

## Hourly Push — 2026-04-17T17:00 AKDT
Steel.dev three-tier recording system committed: Tier 1 manifest, Tier 2 dashboard +
Recording Studio room in PLATO MUD, Tier 3 steel-recorder.py control script. Quest
pending directories seeded for all four RTX drill items. Marketplace submission
structure live. Validation gate stubbed, pending user implementation. No recordings
executed yet — Steel.dev Docker not yet deployed. Committing and pushing per I2I cadence.
